My name is Yanbo Chen (陈彦伯). I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Ottawa. My supervisor is [Andrej Bogdanov](https://andrejb.net/). I spent the first semester of my Ph.D. at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) before I came to Ottawa. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology in 2021 from Fudan University, where I also worked for one year as a research assistant host by Yunlei Zhao. My main research interest is in cryptography.
